# Importing SFM Databases into FLEx
{: .fs-7 }

This site collects details about all aspects of importing an SFM database into FLEx.

Need to write a section that describes the differences between Section 1 and the others.

- [Bantu](/docs/Special-Consideration-databases/bantu) (not written yet)
  - provides details specific to importing dictionaries for Bantu languages, with special attention to noun classes and plurals.
- [PLB imports](/docs/Special-Consideration-databases/PLBImports) (not written yet)
  - goes into further detail on some features that primarily occur in databases for languages stored in the Philippines Branch (PLB) version of standard format markers.
