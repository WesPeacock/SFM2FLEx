# 3 Validate structure
Making sure the structure of the database reflects what the linguist intended is crucial to doing an import that gives the linguist the closest thing to what they last had in their Toolbox database.  Importing the wrong structure really constitutes "loss of data", because they are having to fix things that didn't seem broken to them when they were in Toolbox.  (They are aware of all the lexicography they need to continue to do; they don't want additional work added on to fix things that are the result of the import process.

## A. Establish a convention for making notes to the linguist

## B. Use Solid to validate the structure [needs work]
