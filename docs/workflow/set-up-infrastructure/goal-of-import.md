# Goal of Import

Determine the goal of the import. Possibilites include:
 - Webonary
 - PDF or paper publication
 - further work in FLEx
   - by whom?
 - archive.

These answers will shape how much effort you put into different aspects of the import project.

If the goal is to publish on Webonary
  - Encourage linguist to apply for the site right away (<https://www.webonary.org/application-for-webonary-account/> )
  - Ask them to start thinking about front/back matter, and connect them with someone who can help them start putting that on the site, even before the import is done.
  - Explain that you will place sample uploads on this site as you go along.
  - Explain the difference between being able to see the sample site, versus the site actually being published.
