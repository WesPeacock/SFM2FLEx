# Set Up a Working Terminal

Decide if you will be working in a Windows terminal or a Linux terminal.
  - In a Windows terminal, you can use Strawberry Perl to run Perl scripts.  However, there are additional details needed for working in a Windows environment, and those are not covered here.
  - A simple way to get a Linux terminal is to [install Ubuntu](https://sites.google.com/sil.org/importing-sfm-to-flex/workflow/1-set-up-infrastructure/b-set-up-a-linux-terminal?authuser=0) for Windows.

Be sure you understand how to [access perl scripts on Github](https://sites.google.com/sil.org/importing-sfm-to-flex/workflow/1-set-up-infrastructure/c-how-to-download-perl-scripts-from-github?authuser=0).
