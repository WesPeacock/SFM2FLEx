# Set Up a Working Directory

Set up your working directory.
  - This would be whatever folder on your Windows system contains the data files you are working on.
  - You may have a lot of files associated with this project.  You may find it easiest to make a "working folder" that starts out with only the Toolbox .db file that you will be importing.  As you go through the process on this site, you will be adding scripts and creating various versions of that file in this folder, so it may be helpful to have everything else related to the project stored in separate folders before you begin.
  - As you encounter scripts that you need, you would download those into this directory also.  Most of them assume that the script is in the same directory as the data file.
