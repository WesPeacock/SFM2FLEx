# Communication

Set up communication methods between import specialist and linguist.
  - Email?
  - Skype?
  - How often?

Determine if any aspects of the data are sensitive.  When creating folders for data or talking about it with other import specialists, respect the wishes of the linguist regarding whether to use the actual language name or not, or names of specific individuals.
