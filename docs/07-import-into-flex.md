[Draft comments about Phase 5 errors:

There are quite a few situations that can cause failures in phase 5, missing or incorrect homograph numbers, non-digit characters in homograph numbers, variants or subentries identical to the entry headword, circular references (e.g., entry a is a variant/subentry of entry b which is a variant/subentry of entry a), etc. The errors are almost always related to variants, subentries, or main entries, but could be lexical relations or possibly references to other lists. One way to help isolate a problem outside the debugger is to disable some of the reference fields to see what makes it go away. ]
