# Advanced Import Techniques
Some of the scenarios that may occur in an import project have solutions that the DLS team has developed tentative solutions to, but using them requires more technical skill than most of the other techniques presented on this site.  These solutions are presented in this separate section because they may be of use to some, but others may find them too challenging to apply.  If you try these out and they are helpful, let us know!  And if you have the ability to help us refine these techniques and submit improvements, we welcome the collaboration.
