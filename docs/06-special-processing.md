# 6 Special Processing
[This section has not been written yet.

It will discuss some more advanced steps that may need to be applied and explain where they fit in the workflow.

Then it will provide a link to an "Advanced Techniques" page that has more details about each specific procedure (or links to pages dedicated to each procedure).  That page will cover issues like:
- Subentries of senses
- Tables
- Extra links inserted after the import
- Merging homographic complex forms

That page has not been written yet either.]
